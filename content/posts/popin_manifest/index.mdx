PopIn is a project aimed at analyzing how market and consumer pressures created the environment that our current social media platforms were developed under and thrive in. 
I am interested particularly in the ethical consequences that certain design decisions have on consumer wellbeing. 
The ultimate goal is to design a social media platform that takes into account these pitfalls; levying the power of connected 
technologies to connect people with similar interests in their proximity and beyond, and (most importantly) mitigating the 
social, psychological, and economic costs associated with dominant platforms to the consumer.
